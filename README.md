# no-ghosts
no-ghost is a game built using C++ and SFML library in which a good ghost tries to kill other evil ghosts from the sky

# Running the game
- You need to install SFML library in your IDE: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/ (i used CodeBlocks, that's why there is .cbp file in the repo)
- After installing SFML, make sure all folders in this repo are imported in your IDE or the same directory as main.cpp file
- Build and run main.cpp, there should be no problems
